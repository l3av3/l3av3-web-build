# L3AV3 – Division Agent Landing Page (Build Only)

This repository contains the **public build output** of my personal landing page as a Division 1 & 2 agent and streamer.

## About

The page is a clean, single-page **Division-inspired profile** with:

- Hero header with status indicator and game art
- Links to Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Spotify, Discord and Instagram
- Agent briefing with SK/EN language switch
- Rig / setup card with PC hardware
- Subtle glow effects, hover flares and a small SHD-style boot animation

Everything is designed to look like a small in-universe SHD terminal for my Division streams.

## Tech Stack (for the original project)

The original project (in a private repo) is built with:

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- `lucide-react` for icons

This repository is just the **`dist/`** output of that project, deployed via GitHub Pages.
